Flask-Potion
============

**Flask-Potion** is a powerful Flask extension for building RESTful JSON APIs.
Potion features include validation, model resources and routes, relations, object permissions, filtering, sorting,
pagination, signals, and automatic API schema generation.

Potion is designed to handle SQLAlchemy models, but it is also possible to integrate other data stores,
or even use parts of Potion without any data store at all.
